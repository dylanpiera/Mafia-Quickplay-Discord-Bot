# Mafia Quickplay Discord Bot

### What's this?
We're trying to make a Discord bot that allows us to host Quickplay Mafia games without a host needed.
As we've only just started our project we won't have any explanation here yet. But come back once we have more and we'll have explanations on:
- How to add our bot to your server
- How to setup the bot
- How to use the bot

If you'd like to help us create this project, fork and contact us! All help is welcomed.

### About us
We are just some fokes who play Mafia on the Bulbagarden forums
we're interested in creating a bot for our discord server and are trying to realise this.

We welcome everyone to join us in our mafia games!
